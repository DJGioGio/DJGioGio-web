            <h3>Q:</h3>
            <p>Why is your name GioGio?</p>
            <h3>A:</h3>
            <p>It's because one of my favorite characters are from
                JoJo's Bizzare Adventure, the character is named Giorno Giovanna 
                so I took a bit of inspiration from his name.
                <br>(I know the name is not that original but I don't care)</p>
            <h3>Q:</h3>

            <h3>A:</h3>
