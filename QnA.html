            <p style="font-size: 34px;">Q:</p>
            <p>Are you diagnosed with ADHD or undiagnosed?</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">A:</p>
            <p>I got diagnosed with ADHD long ago, I have problems with keeping focused sometimes and also I often distract myself a bit too much...</p>

            <p style="font-size: 34px;">Q:</p>
            <p>What are you favourite genres of music?</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">A:</p>
            <p>Good question, I listen to almost anything except a few genres, I'm mostly into genres that are from techno to hardcore (mostly speedcore and uptempo).</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">Q:</p>
            <p>Do you stream on twitch?</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">A:</p>
            <p>Yes but not really often.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">Q:</p>
            <p>How long do you take to make your tracks?</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">A:</p>
            <p>It depends on my motivation, energies and stuff, I can take from one week to a whole month with multiple breaks, etc.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">Q:</p>
            <p>Is making Roblox renders in Roblox Studio easy?</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">A:</p>
            <p>It depends, it's easy to work on the poses but on the rest it can go from simple to complicates such as making background elements and making models in blender (I do not reccomend you
            to make a model by only using blocks in roblox studio, it's complicated and useless to work on it).</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">Q:</p>
            <p>What are your common thoughts?</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">A:</p>
            <p>I mostly think about anything but generally I think about some stuff about technology, PC related things, sometimes other poisitive and negative things,
            sometimes I think about me being weird as fuck but I don't mind about it anymore.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">Q:</p>
            <p>What's the point of the <a class="link" href="DNIList.html" style="font-size: 24px;">DNI list?</a></p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">A:</p>
            <p>I don't know why would you even ask for this, I just made it for my own privacy reasons, also because I'm entirely against at terrible people.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">Q:</p>
            <p>Is making music like speedcore difficult?</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">A:</p>
            <p>It takes some practice but ehhh, it's mixed.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 34px;">Q:</p>
